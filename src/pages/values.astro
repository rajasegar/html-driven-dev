Always strive for this particular value in all you do. This will make your life better. But, remember achieving simplicity is hard.</p><div class="mt-8 text-right"><a class="bg-indigo-600 text-white border-indigo-300 px-4 py-4 shadow-2xl hover:bg-indigo-700 rounded" href="/values/simplicity" aria-label="Know more">Know more</a></div></div><div class="h-100 p-8 bg-white rounded text-gray-600 shadow flex flex-col justify-between dark:bg-gray-800"><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold py-2 text-indigo-600 dark:text-indigo-400">Performance</h2><p class="dark:text-white">Web performance is all about making web sites fast, including making slow processes seem fast. Does the site load quickly, allow the user to start interacting with it quickly, and offer reassuring feedback if something is taking time to load (e.g. a loading spinner)? </p><div class="mt-8 text-right"><a class="bg-indigo-600 text-white border-indigo-300 px-4 py-4 shadow-2xl hover:bg-indigo-700 rounded" href="https://web.dev/vitals" aria-label="Know more">Know more</a></div></div><div class="h-100 p-8 bg-white rounded text-gray-600 shadow flex flex-col justify-between dark:bg-gray-800"><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold py-2 text-indigo-600 dark:text-indigo-400">Developer Experience</h2><p class="dark:text-white"> Developer Experience is a term with a self-declaring meaning — the experience of developers — but it eludes definition in the sense that people invoke it at different times for different reasons referring to different things.</p><div class="mt-8 text-right"><a class="bg-indigo-600 text-white border-indigo-300 px-4 py-4 shadow-2xl hover:bg-indigo-700 rounded" href="https://css-tricks.com/what-is-developer-experience-dx/" aria-label="Know more">Know more</a></div></div><div class="h-100 p-8 bg-white rounded text-gray-600 shadow flex flex-col justify-between dark:bg-gray-800"><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold py-2 text-indigo-600 dark:text-indigo-400">Single Code base</h2><p class="dark:text-white"> Having a Single Code base collapses as many unnecessary conceptual models as possible. Eliminates as much needless abstraction as you can swing a hammer at. It’s a big fat no to distributing your system lest it truly prevents you from doing what really needs to be done.</p><div class="mt-8 text-right"><a class="bg-indigo-600 text-white border-indigo-300 px-4 py-4 shadow-2xl hover:bg-indigo-700 rounded" href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/the-majestic-monolith/" aria-label="Know more">Know more</a></div></div><div class="h-100 p-8 bg-white rounded text-gray-600 shadow flex flex-col justify-between dark:bg-gray-800"><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold py-2 text-indigo-600 dark:text-indigo-400">Single source of State</h2><p class="dark:text-white"> Try to keep your application state in one place, like on the server, to avoid state synchronization issues and keep your view layers light and fast. Your view layer should only manipulate the state it requires to render the  view, not anything else. You should avoid storing large amounts of application data in the browser or the client side.</p><div class="mt-8 text-right"><a class="bg-indigo-600 text-white border-indigo-300 px-4 py-4 shadow-2xl hover:bg-indigo-700 rounded" href="https://gist.github.com/SteveSandersonMS/ba16f6bb6934842d78c89ab5314f4b56" aria-label="Know more">Know more</a></div></div><div class="h-100 p-8 bg-white rounded text-gray-600 shadow flex flex-col justify-between dark:bg-gray-800"><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold py-2 text-indigo-600 dark:text-indigo-400">Search-friendly Routing</h2><p class="dark:text-white"> Almost every website or web-application uses routing. Discovering a website by changing its URL is a very powerful feature that comes standard with the web. How all of this is handled can vary a lot between different websites and web-applications.</p><div class="mt-8 text-right"><a class="bg-indigo-600 text-white border-indigo-300 px-4 py-4 shadow-2xl hover:bg-indigo-700 rounded" href="https://magento.com/blog/technical/server-side-vs-client-side-rendering-and-changing-seo-practices" aria-label="Know more">Know more</a></div></div><div class="h-100 p-8 bg-white rounded text-gray-600 shadow flex flex-col justify-between dark:bg-gray-800"><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold py-2 text-indigo-600 dark:text-indigo-400">Accessibility</h2><p class="dark:text-white">Accessibility is the practice of making your websites usable by as many people as possible. We traditionally think of this as being about people with disabilities, but the practice of making sites accessible also benefits other groups such as those using mobile devices, or those with slow network connections.</p><div class="mt-8 text-right"><a class="bg-indigo-600 text-white border-indigo-300 px-4 py-4 shadow-2xl hover:bg-indigo-700 rounded" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility/What:is:accessibility#:~:text=Accessibility%20is%20the%20practice%20of,those%20with%20slow%20network%20connections." aria-label="Know more">Know more</a></div></div><div class="h-100 p-8 bg-white rounded text-gray-600 shadow flex flex-col justify-between dark:bg-gray-800"><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold py-2 text-indigo-600 dark:text-indigo-400">Energy Efficiency</h2><p class="dark:text-white">The internet consumes a lot of electricity. 416.2TWh per year to be precise. To give you some perspective, that’s more than the entire United Kingdom. From data centres to transmission networks to the devices that we hold in our hands, it is all consuming electricity, and in turn producing carbon emissions.</p><div class="mt-8 text-right"><a class="bg-indigo-600 text-white border-indigo-300 px-4 py-4 shadow-2xl hover:bg-indigo-700 rounded" href="/values/energy-efficiency" aria-label="Know more">Know more</a></div></div></div></main>
